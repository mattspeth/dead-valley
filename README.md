Dead Valley Redux

Escape from Zombie-infested Dead Valley in this HTML5 Grand Theft Auto style Game.

Working on tweaking UI elements that are bothersome, increasing game area for larger modern monitors and screens.  Changing some in game assets to simplify inventory, tone of the game.  More of a mod than a full-blown game fork.

===========

Running the Game
